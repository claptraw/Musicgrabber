"""Following an artist splits into two independent switches: singles and albums.

Before v4 the two were welded together; watching an artist always meant watching
their singles, and albums were an optional extra bolted on top. Now you can have
either, or both, and an albums-only follow must not go hoovering up every B-side
the artist has ever released.

Real schema via db.init_db() against a throwaway database, MusicBrainz fully
mocked, no server and no network. Same style as test_artist_albums.py.
