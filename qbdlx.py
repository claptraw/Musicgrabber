MusicGrabber - direct Qobuz fallback

When browser-authenticated Monochrome playback cannot resolve a track, this
module talks to the official Qobuz API directly, signing requests with a shared
free-account token (the same pool the qbdlx web UI at
qbdlx.launchpd.cloud hands out under its "Free account" tab).

The flow mirrors classic qobuz-dl:
  1. GET a pool of {token, app_id, app_secret, country} from the shared webhook.
  2. catalog/search?query=ISRC  ->  track_id
  3. track/getFileUrl (signed)  ->  a real streaming-qobuz-std.akamaized.net URL

Signature scheme (verified live):
  request_sig = MD5("trackgetFileUrl" + "format_id"+fmt + "intent"+"stream"
                    + "track_id"+id + ts + app_secret)
  headers: X-App-Id, X-User-Auth-Token

Important: the free shared tokens resolve to 16-bit/44.1kHz lossless FLAC
(format_id 6), NOT 24-bit hi-res, no matter which format you ask for. That's
fine for a fallback. A genuine FLAC beats a download that face-plants.

Some tokens in the pool get quietly downgraded by Qobuz to 30-second preview
MP3s (the response carries "sample": true and format_id 5, whatever format_id
was actually requested). We walk straight past those and keep trying tokens
until one hands back the real thing, because nobody asked for the chorus on
a loop.
