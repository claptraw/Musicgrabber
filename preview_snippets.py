"""Short-lived, decrypted preview snippets.

Monochrome's unified playback only ever hands back CENC-encrypted FLAC-in-MP4,
whatever quality you ask it for, and no browser will play a note of that.
Downloads already solve this with ffmpeg and an in-memory key; previews get the
same treatment on a much smaller scale. The opening seconds are decrypted and
transcoded to MP3, parked in a temp directory under an unguessable token, and
served back through MusicGrabber rather than the CDN.

Kept deliberately light on imports: the auth middleware resolves these tokens
on every snippet request and has no business dragging the whole Monochrome
stack along for the ride.
