MusicGrabber - Source URL validation

The browser hands us a `source` and a `source_url` and asks us to go and fetch
it. Left unchecked that is a request to make the server fetch anything at all,
from inside the container: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/...`, the NAS admin panel
next door on the Docker network, `http://169.254.169.254/` on a cloud box. The
declared source proves nothing, since the caller writes that too.

So every URL-backed source gets a hostname allowlist, and the URL must actually
belong to the provider it claims to come from. Substring tests like
`"soundcloud.com" in url` are not a boundary; `https://soundcloud.com.evil.tld/`
and `http://10.0.0.5/?q=soundcloud.com` both sail straight through one. Hostname
suffix matching is the whole point of this module.

If a provider moves to a new CDN, downloads from it will start failing here with
a clear message rather than mysteriously; add the new host below.
