# Music Grabber
**v3.1.0**

A self-hosted music acquisition service. Search YouTube, SoundCloud, zvu4no, FreeMp3Cloud, Monochrome/Qobuz, and optional Soulseek, tap a result and it downloads the best quality audio straight into your music library. You'll have a choice to convert to a common format, or store as is.

If you find it useful, consider buying me a coffee: https://ko-fi.com/geekphreek

## Why?

It started as the "I want one song, not a commitment" tool: Lidarr's great for albums, but grabbing a single track you heard on the radio shouldn't require navigating menus or pulling an artist's entire discography. Search, tap, done; that's still the heart of it.

It has since grown well past that brief. Watched Playlists and Watched Artists keep your library current on their own, checking six playlist platforms plus MusicBrainz for new singles so you don't have to remember to. Multi-source search now reaches proper lossless Qobuz and Soulseek alongside YouTube and SoundCloud; Album mode handles the odd full release; track upgrades, provenance auditing, and multi-user support round out the rest. It's not trying to become Lidarr (see below); it just turns out "grab one song" was the thin end of a much bigger wedge.

## What this project is not

MusicGrabber is intentionally narrow. It is **not**:

- **A full music manager** (not Lidarr, not a replacement for Navidrome/Jellyfin)
- **A back-catalogue hoover** (followed artists can opt in to collecting new albums as they are released, but nothing ever retro-downloads a discography; switching that on marks everything already out as seen)
- **A streaming server/player** (it acquires files; it does not serve or stream your library)
- **A DJ/pro-audio workflow tool** (no Atmos/spatial-audio specialist pipeline)
- **A custom library templating engine** (no advanced token-based naming/structure rules)

## Features

- **Multi-source search:** the Tracks tab searches YouTube, SoundCloud, zvu4no, FreeMp3Cloud, Monochrome/Qobuz, and optional Soulseek in parallel; relevance-ranked results include source badges and score explanations, plus a separate audio-quality tier where the provider declares one. The single-song search collapses when you leave Tracks, keeping the other workspaces focused on their own jobs
- **Live search progress:** results stream in as each source answers, with live status for completed, slow, parked, or unavailable sources; repeated timeouts automatically bench an unhealthy source until a background probe clears it. yt-dlp searches and metadata lookups share a bounded retry policy for throttling, timeouts, gateway failures, and reduced format manifests, while genuinely private/deleted media fails immediately
- **Monochrome/Qobuz source:** searches the Tidal catalogue via hifi-api metadata, then resolves matching Qobuz FLAC streams by ISRC. Public Qobuz routes are tried first; if they fail, an optional SeleniumBase browser session can complete Monochrome's Turnstile check and use its authorised direct playback. Enabled by default and configurable in Search Sources
- **Watched playlists:** monitor Spotify, YouTube (including Mixes), Amazon Music, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Tidal, Beatport, Monochrome, and ListenBrainz playlists; auto-downloads new tracks and grabs the best match available. Per-playlist sync mode: Append (M3U grows as tracks arrive) or Mirror (M3U stays in sync with the upstream; removed tracks drop out). Each card shows live refresh state and stage. "Missing" button shows tracks that never made it; Retry and Search buttons to fix them. M3U updates immediately as each track finishes
- **Artists tab:** follow an artist on MusicBrainz and new singles are downloaded automatically as they appear. Search by name, pick from up to five candidates, set a from-date (defaults to today so your back-catalogue stays put). Singles come first: remixes, live cuts, soundtracks, and compilations are filtered out at the MusicBrainz level. Albums sit underneath for browsing and picking off individually, with an optional "automatically add new albums" toggle that marks everything already released as seen, so ticking it never starts a back-catalogue download. Tracks already on disk are recognised immediately, and followed-album labels are derived from the current import and actual audio count rather than preserving “Queued” until the sun burns out. Per-artist check interval, Keep source/Convert to control, pause/resume, missing and track list panels. You can also browse any artist's albums without following them at all
- **Playlist routing:** pick any watched playlist or existing `.m3u` file from the selector below the search bar; downloads land there instead of Singles
- **Playlist housekeeping:** find audio left behind by mirror-mode playlist removals and move it safely into Singles; optionally stamp watched-playlist names into audio Comment tags for macOS Music smart playlists
- **Album mode:** browse MusicBrainz artists from either the Artists tab or Bulk Import, pick a release, download the full album into `Albums/Artist/Album/`, tag tracks with album context, write cover files, and optionally generate an album-local M3U. Equivalent folders and numbered/fuzzy track names inside the configured Albums tree are reused rather than downloaded again. Multi-disc and Various Artists groups choose the most complete official release and keep the canonical release-group credit/title
- **Bulk Import takes almost anything:** playlist URLs, pasted `Artist - Title` lists, MusicBrainz release links, Spotify and Apple Music album URLs, or simply an album name typed in. Anything recognised as an album is routed through the album pipeline rather than flattened into loose singles. Album search does not need an artist first, so soundtracks and various-artists compilations work; uncertain matches ask which release you meant instead of guessing. YouTube, Amazon, Beatport, and Monochrome album URLs are not supported yet
- **Auto-album routing for singles:** optional setting to file single-track downloads into artist/album folders when MusicBrainz resolves an album, either under Singles or the Albums directory
- **Bulk import:** paste or upload a text file of "Artist - Title" lines; searches enabled sources in parallel and grabs the best result for each. It can also create a playlist and route files into the Playlists directory or a custom watched-playlist folder. Cancel stops untouched work, lets the one active file finish, and keeps completed files and Queue history
- **Similar artist discovery:** hover any result and click Similar to explore related artists via MusicBrainz and ListenBrainz Labs. Download the lot in one go with "Download All", optionally saved as a playlist
- **Apprise notifications:** one URL covers Gotify, ntfy, Discord, Pushover, Slack, and about 50 others. Also supports Telegram webhook and SMTP email
- **Navidrome/Lidarr duplicate heads-up:** searches warn when a track is already known to either library, including when a playlist says `Primary Artist, Guest` but the library quite reasonably files it under `Primary Artist`; Navidrome can also prevent the duplicate download and reuse the existing path for playlist routing
- **Best quality audio:** new installations keep the provider's source format by default. Optional conversion supports FLAC, ALAC/AAC-in-M4A, Opus, or MP3, with quality settings for lossy formats and clear warnings that a larger container cannot resurrect audio already lost in action
- **Track upgrades:** opt-in library scanner re-probes and hashes MusicGrabber files
  on the configured interval, flags files below your quality tier, follows tagged
  files moved inside the library, and revalidates the original immediately before
  any safe, recoverable replacement. Proposals distinguish the quality of the
  downloaded source from the configured stored output, so a lossless source headed
  for Opus, MP3, or AAC is clearly labelled as a lossy converted result
- **Audio Provenance Audit:** a separate read-only scan of the complete configured
  music directory, including Albums and historical files. It distinguishes the
  stored format from recorded acquisition history, explains every classification,
  leaves uncertain lossless-looking files unknown, and exports filtered CSV/JSON
  dry-run reports
- **Loudness normalisation:** optional two-pass EBU R128 normalisation brings lossy web sources to -14 LUFS without touching lossless masters
- **Automatic Music import:** optionally copy each completed download into a mounted macOS Music "Automatically Add to Music" folder
- **Enhanced metadata:** AcoustID audio fingerprinting with MusicBrainz lookups, falling back to source tags. For "Artist - Title" queries, MusicBrainz expected duration is used as a scoring signal at search time, so a 1:41 DJ edit won't outrank the 3:31 original
- **Manual picks remain deliberate, not gullible:** choosing a live version, remix or edit is allowed to disagree with MusicBrainz, but MusicGrabber remembers the duration shown on that exact result and rejects downloaded bytes that are substantially shorter. A valid 30-second CDN preview can no longer dress up as the four-minute track you clicked
- **Synced lyrics:** automatic lyrics fetching from LRClib, saved as `.lrc` files
- **Auto-organise:** `Singles/Artist/Title.flac` (or flat `Singles/Artist - Title.flac` with "Organise by Artist" off). Optional track-number filenames produce `Singles/Artist/1 - Title.flac` when metadata includes a track number. Album mode uses `Albums/Artist/Album/Track.flac`
- **Duplicate detection:** local filesystem check plus optional Navidrome Subsonic API check
- **Trash bin:** deleted files move to `/data/.trash/` instead of being permanently removed; restore with one click to skip re-downloading. Files that fail mismatch or duration checks also land in the trash so you can listen before they vanish
- **In-queue playback:** play button on completed queue cards and trashed files for instant preview without leaving the tab
- **Job queue:** track progress, retry failures, re-download or delete files, see metadata provenance
- **Statistics dashboard:** download counts, success rate, daily chart, top artists, search analytics
- **Release notes modal:** shows once after each update; also accessible from the Settings tab
- **Preview:** hover a result for 2 seconds on desktop, or tap Preview on mobile
- **Dark/light theme:** toggle in the header; preference saved per browser
- **Mobile-friendly UI:** designed for quick searches from your phone
- **Settings tab:** configure all integrations via UI; no docker-compose editing required
- **Multi-user support:** create user accounts with role-based access. Admins manage global settings; standard users get their own queue, watched playlists/artists, notifications, and credentials. Peon users get the stripped-back tabs and inherit global conversion/source settings, for when you want "download this song", not "reconfigure the mothership". Single-user installs work exactly as before with no configuration changes
- **Optional API authentication:** protect your instance with an API key
- **YouTube cookie support:** upload browser cookies in Settings to bypass bot detection
- **Spotify cookie support:** upload cookies from `open.spotify.com` to access private playlists, saved albums, and personal library playlists
- **Minimum bitrate enforcement:** optionally reject downloads below a configurable threshold
- **PUID/PGID support:** run as a specific user for correct file ownership on NAS/SMB shares
- **Optional Navidrome/Jellyfin/Lidarr integration:** auto-triggers library rescan after downloads
- **Soulseek integration:** optional slskd support for P2P search and downloads
- **Report/blacklist:** flag bad results from the queue; blacklisted videos and uploaders are suppressed from future searches

## Source format and conversion

MusicGrabber keeps the provider's source format by default. This avoids unnecessary re-encoding and prevents a lossy web download from turning up in a FLAC overcoat pretending it has always summered in the south of France.

If you prefer a uniform library, choose **Convert to** and select FLAC, ALAC, Opus, or MP3. Opus, MP3, and the bitrate-limited AAC-in-M4A choices are lossy; when one is selected the Settings screen warns that converting a lossless source will permanently discard quality. FLAC and true ALAC preserve genuinely lossless input, but converting YouTube, SoundCloud, MP3, AAC, or Opus audio to a lossless container cannot restore information that has already gone missing. Monochrome and Soulseek may provide native lossless files; MusicGrabber records the known source and stored formats separately so the distinction survives the trip into your library.

## Audio Provenance Audit

Open **Watched → Audio Provenance Audit** and choose **Run Audit**. The scan
walks every supported audio file beneath the configured music directory,
including Singles, Playlists, Albums, and older files MusicGrabber did not
download. Symlinks and known trash, upgrade-quarantine, and acquisition-staging
directories are excluded, as are NAS-generated bins (`@Recycle`, `#recycle`,
`.Trash-1000`, `$RECYCLE.BIN`) and metadata folders (`@eaDir`,
`System Volume Information`, `lost+found`, the macOS Spotlight caches). The
same exclusion list is shared by the track-upgrades scan and the Stats storage
figure, so none of them count files you deleted weeks ago that the NAS has
quietly held on to. Album folders genuinely named *Trash* are unaffected; only
the hidden bin names above are skipped. A new result only becomes current when the whole scan
has completed, so a failed scan cannot replace the last complete report.
Interactive library views take priority over the background reader, so a large
NAS audit waits its turn rather than making the rest of the UI seize up.

The report keeps three ideas separate:

- **Stored format** is what the file is now: its container, codec, observed
  bitrate, sample rate, and bit depth where available.
- **Recorded provenance** comes from MusicGrabber's `SOURCE`,
  `SOURCE_QUALITY`, `SOURCE_CODEC`, and `SOURCE_BITRATE` tags, including the
  older human-readable tag format.
- **Effective quality** is a conservative conclusion from those two sets of
  evidence. A lossy input converted to FLAC remains lossy; a historical FLAC
  with no decisive provenance remains unknown.

Each file is placed in one of these classes:

| Classification | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Known lossy transcode | A lossless codec now stores audio whose recorded acquisition codec was lossy |
| Native lossy acquisition | Both the stored file and recorded acquisition are lossy |
| Lossy derivative of recorded lossless | A lossy file was made from an acquisition recorded as lossless |
| Recorded lossless acquisition | Both stored and acquisition codecs were recorded as lossless |
| Historical or unknown provenance | The available history is missing or too ambiguous for a firmer conclusion |
| Unreadable audio file | The extension is supported but Mutagen could not inspect the file |

“Recorded lossless” is intentionally not called “genuine lossless.” Container,
bitrate, metadata, and spectral analysis cannot prove that a file has never
passed through a lossy encoder. The audit currently performs no spectral
analysis at all; it would only ever be a labelled heuristic, not a promotion
ticket for uncertain files. A 1,000 kbps FLAC can wear a very impressive
waistcoat and still know nothing about its childhood.

Filter by classification, container, codec, acquisition source, effective
quality, or use the two deliberately separate lossless views:

- **Stored in a lossless codec** includes unknown-history lossless-looking files.
- **Recorded lossless acquisition** includes only files whose acquisition
  metadata records a lossless codec.

CSV and JSON exports include the scan version, filters, evidence, caveats, and
an explicit dry-run notice. The audit never renames, retags, moves, deletes, or
replaces audio. It also does not feed anything into Watched Upgrades yet; that
bridge stays out until the report has earned trust with real libraries.

## Quick Start

### Option A: Using Docker Hub (Recommended)

1. **Create a docker-compose.yml**
   ```yaml
   services:
     music-grabber:
       image: g33kphr33k/musicgrabber:latest
       container_name: music-grabber
       restart: unless-stopped
       # Required for Spotify playlists over 100 tracks (headless browser)
       shm_size: '2gb'
       ports:
         - "38274:8080"
       volumes:
         - /path/to/your/music:/music
         - ./data:/data
       environment:
         - MUSIC_DIR=/music
         - DB_PATH=/data/music_grabber.db
         # Optional: serve behind a reverse-proxy subpath (proxy must strip the prefix)
         # - ROOT_PATH=/musicgrabber
         - ENABLE_MUSICBRAINZ=true
         # Optional: convert downloads instead of keeping the provider's source format
         # - DEFAULT_CONVERT_TO_FLAC=true
         # Optional: Run as specific user (like *arr stack) for correct file permissions
         # - PUID=1000
         # - PGID=1000
         # Optional: Custom bind address/port (useful for IPv6 or non-standard setups)
         # - LISTEN_ADDR=0.0.0.0
         # - LISTEN_PORT=8080
         # Optional: Navidrome auto-rescan
         # - NAVIDROME_URL=http://navidrome:4533
         # - NAVIDROME_USER=admin
         # - NAVIDROME_PASS=yourpassword
         # Optional: Jellyfin auto-rescan
         # - JELLYFIN_URL=http://jellyfin:8096
         # - JELLYFIN_API_KEY=your-jellyfin-api-key
         # Optional: Notifications
         # - NOTIFY_ON=playlists,bulk,errors
         # - TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/sendMessage?chat_id={chat_id}
         # - WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/hook
         # - SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
         # - SMTP_PORT=587
         # - SMTP_USER=user@example.com
         # - SMTP_PASS=password
         # - SMTP_TO=you@example.com
   ```

2. **Run**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the UI** at `http://your-server:38274`

### Option B: Unraid (Community Applications)

If you're running Unraid, the easiest way is via Community Applications. Search for **MusicGrabber** and install directly from Docker Hub.

For manual setup, or if you want a reference for the XML config, here's a working Unraid template:

```xml
<Config Name="Appdata" Target="/data" Default="" Mode="rw" Description="" Type="Path" Display="always" Required="false" Mask="false">/mnt/user/appdata/musicgrabber/</Config>
<Config Name="Music" Target="/music" Default="" Mode="rw" Description="" Type="Path" Display="always" Required="false" Mask="false">/mnt/user/media/music/</Config>
<Config Name="MUSIC_DIR" Target="MUSIC_DIR" Default="" Mode="" Description="" Type="Variable" Display="always" Required="false" Mask="false">/music</Config>
<Config Name="DB_PATH" Target="DB_PATH" Default="" Mode="" Description="" Type="Variable" Display="always" Required="false" Mask="false">/data/music_grabber.db</Config>
<Config Name="ENABLE_MUSICBRAINZ" Target="ENABLE_MUSICBRAINZ" Default="" Mode="" Description="" Type="Variable" Display="always" Required="false" Mask="false">true</Config>
<Config Name="DEFAULT_CONVERT_TO_FLAC" Target="DEFAULT_CONVERT_TO_FLAC" Default="" Mode="" Description="" Type="Variable" Display="always" Required="false" Mask="false">false</Config>
<Config Name="PUID" Target="PUID" Default="" Mode="" Description="" Type="Variable" Display="always" Required="false" Mask="false">99</Config>
<Config Name="PGID" Target="PGID" Default="" Mode="" Description="" Type="Variable" Display="always" Required="false" Mask="false">100</Config>
```

PUID `99` and PGID `100` are Unraid's standard `nobody`/`users`, these give the container correct write access to your shares. Adjust if your setup differs.

### Option C: Build from Source

1. **Clone and configure**
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/g33kphr33k/musicgrabber.git
   cd musicgrabber
   ```

2. **Edit docker-compose.yml**

   Update the music volume path and optionally add Navidrome credentials:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - /path/to/your/music:/music  # <-- your music directory
     - ./data:/data                # <-- keep the job database
   ```
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - NAVIDROME_URL=http://navidrome:4533
     - NAVIDROME_USER=admin
     - NAVIDROME_PASS=yourpassword
   ```

3. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

4. **Access the UI**

   Open `http://your-server:38274` on your phone or browser.

### Option D: Windows 10+ (One-Click Setup)

If you're running Windows and don't want to touch the command line, the `windows/` folder has batch scripts that handle everything for you.

**Requirements:** Windows 10 or later. Docker Desktop will be installed automatically if it isn't already.

1. **Download** the `windows/` folder from the repository (or clone the whole repo)
2. **Right-click `setup.bat`** and select **Run as administrator**

The setup script will:
- Check for Docker Desktop and download/install it if missing (requires a reboot; setup resumes automatically on next login)
- Wait for the Docker engine to finish starting
- Ask where you want your music saved (defaults to `%USERPROFILE%\Music\MusicGrabber`)
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` in `%APPDATA%\MusicGrabber`
- Pull the latest MusicGrabber image
- Optionally start MusicGrabber and open your browser to `http://localhost:38274`

**After setup:**

| Script | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `run.bat` | Starts Docker Desktop (if not running) and launches MusicGrabber |
| `stop.bat` | Stops the MusicGrabber container |

Both scripts are copied to `%APPDATA%\MusicGrabber` during setup. You can also put `run.bat` on your Desktop for easy access.

**Configuration:** music is saved to the folder you chose during setup. The database and config live in `%APPDATA%\MusicGrabber`. To change settings after install, edit `%APPDATA%\MusicGrabber\docker-compose.yml` or use the Settings tab in the web UI.

## Configuration

### Settings Tab (Recommended)

The easiest way to configure MusicGrabber is via the **Settings tab** in the UI. You can configure:

- **General**: MusicBrainz and Deezer metadata, lyrics fetching, default conversion, minimum bitrate, live-version rejection, and optional loudness normalisation
- **Audio format**: FLAC, ALAC/AAC-in-M4A, Opus, or MP3, including MP3/Opus/ALAC quality presets
- **Library layout**: Singles, Playlists, and Albums subfolders, track-number filenames, auto-album routing, playlist album/comment tagging, automatic Music import, singles-only mode, and file permissions
- **Search sources**: enable/disable YouTube, SoundCloud, zvu4no, FreeMp3Cloud, Soulseek, and Monochrome; configure cross-source fallback, automatic health checks, and a per-provider search limit from 1–5 (default 1). Download concurrency remains deliberately internal and conservative
- **Track upgrades**: scan the library for files below the configured quality tier and control the scan interval
- **Monochrome**: hifi-api URL, Qobuz proxy URL, qbdlx fallback, and browser-authenticated Turnstile fallback
- **Soulseek (slskd)**: enable toggle, URL, credentials, downloads path
- **Navidrome**: URL and credentials for library refresh
- **Jellyfin**: URL and API key for library refresh
- **Lidarr**: URL and API key for library refresh
- **Notifications**: Apprise URL, Telegram webhook, generic webhook URL, and SMTP settings
- **YouTube**: Upload browser cookies for authenticated downloads
- **Spotify**: Upload browser cookies to access private playlists
- **Apple Music**: Add a user token for private library playlists
- **Blacklist**: View and manage reported tracks and blocked uploaders
- **Security**: API key for authentication
- **Users** (admin only): create and manage user accounts, reset passwords

Settings are stored in the database and persist across container restarts.

**Environment variable overrides:** If you set a value via environment variable, it takes precedence over the database value and appears as "locked" in the UI.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PUID` | `0` | User ID for file ownership (like *arr stack); low NAS service IDs such as TrueNAS `568` are supported |
| `PGID` | `0` | Group ID for file ownership (like *arr stack); low NAS service IDs such as TrueNAS `568` are supported |
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address for the web service (set `::` for IPv6 environments) |
| `LISTEN_PORT` | `8080` | Bind port for the web service inside the container |
| `MUSIC_DIR` | `/music` | Music library root inside container |
| `DB_PATH` | `/data/music_grabber.db` | SQLite database path |
| `ROOT_PATH` | *(empty)* | URL prefix when serving behind a reverse proxy subpath, e.g. `/musicgrabber`. Your proxy should strip this prefix before forwarding to MusicGrabber |
| `ENABLE_MUSICBRAINZ` | `true` | Enable MusicBrainz metadata lookups |
| `ENABLE_DEEZER_METADATA` | `true` | Fill album details from Deezer when MusicBrainz has no suitable release metadata |
| `ENABLE_LYRICS` | `true` | Enable automatic lyrics fetching from LRClib |
| `ACOUSTID_API_KEY` | *(shared built-in)* | AcoustID API key for audio fingerprinting. A shared key is built in but **may hit rate limits**. Register a free key at [acoustid.org](https://acoustid.org/login) and set it here (or via Settings tab) to avoid sharing quota |
| `DEFAULT_CONVERT_AUDIO` | `false` | Keep the provider's source format by default. Set to `true` to enable conversion to `AUDIO_FORMAT`. Renamed in v4.0.0; the old `DEFAULT_CONVERT_TO_FLAC` still works and never forced FLAC, which is exactly why it was renamed |
| `AUDIO_FORMAT` | `opus` | Output format when conversion is enabled: `flac`, `alac`, `opus`, or `mp3` |
| `MP3_BITRATE` | `v2` | MP3 quality preset: `v2`, `v0`, `320k`, `256k`, `192k`, or `128k` |
| `OPUS_BITRATE` | `256k` | Opus bitrate: `256k`, `192k`, `128k`, or `96k` |
| `ALAC_BITRATE` | `lossless` | ALAC/M4A quality: `lossless` for true ALAC, or `320k`, `256k`, `192k`, `128k` for AAC-in-M4A |
| `MIN_AUDIO_BITRATE` | `0` | Minimum audio bitrate in kbps. Downloads below this are rejected. 0 = disabled. Lossless (FLAC) always passes |
| `REJECT_LIVE_VERSIONS` | `false` | Reject a confidently identified live recording when the query did not request one |
| `NORMALISE_LOSSY_AUDIO` | `false` | Apply two-pass EBU R128 loudness normalisation to lossy web sources; lossless sources are untouched |
| `ENABLE_REPLAYGAIN` | `false` | Write ReplayGain 2.0 track gain/peak tags on new downloads. Tags only, the audio is never re-encoded. Album gain and peak are added once every track of an album has landed |
| `REPLAYGAIN_REPLACE_EXISTING` | `false` | Overwrite ReplayGain tags a file already carries. Off by default; existing tags are assumed to be deliberate |
| `REPLAYGAIN_REFERENCE_LUFS` | `-18.0` | ReplayGain reference loudness. The 2.0 spec's value; changing it makes your library disagree with everyone else's |
| `AUTO_IMPORT_DIR` | *(empty)* | Copy completed downloads into this directory, such as macOS Music's Automatically Add folder |
| `PLAYLIST_COMMENT_TAGGING` | `false` | Write watched-playlist names into each track's Comment tag |
| `ENABLE_TRACK_UPGRADES` | `false` | Enable scanning for library files below the configured output quality tier |
| `UPGRADE_SCAN_INTERVAL_HOURS` | `24` | Hours between automatic track-upgrade scans |
| `SINGLES_SUBDIR` | `Singles` | Subfolder under `MUSIC_DIR` for normal single-track downloads. Use `.` for the music root |
| `PLAYLISTS_SUBDIR` | *(empty)* | Optional subfolder under `MUSIC_DIR` for playlist-routed downloads. Empty means playlist files use the Singles layout |
| `ALBUMS_SUBDIR` | `Albums` | Subfolder under `MUSIC_DIR` for album-mode downloads. Use `.` for the music root |
| `ORGANISE_BY_ARTIST` | `true` | Create artist subfolders under Singles. Set to `false` for a flat directory |
| `INCLUDE_TRACK_NUMBER_IN_FILENAME` | `false` | Prefix saved filenames with the resolved track number when one is available, e.g. `Singles/Artist/1 - Title.flac` |
| `AUTO_ALBUM_SINGLES` | `false` | If MusicBrainz finds album context for a single, move it into `Artist/Album/` automatically |
| `AUTO_ALBUM_SINGLES_USE_ALBUMS_DIR` | `false` | Put auto-routed singles under the Albums directory instead of under Singles |
| `PLAYLIST_ALBUM_AS_NAME` | `false` | Tag playlist-routed tracks as one compilation using the playlist name as the album |
| `SINGLES_ONLY_MODE` | `false` | Hide the album browsing surfaces (Artists and Bulk Import) while keeping single-track auto-album routing available |
| `FILE_PERMISSIONS` | `666` | File mode applied after downloads. `777` is available for stubborn NAS/share setups |
| `SKIP_DUPES` | `true` | Skip downloads when a matching local file is already found |
| `NAVIDROME_DUPE_CHECK` | `true` | Use Navidrome/Subsonic as part of duplicate detection when Navidrome is configured |
| `WEBHOOK_URL` | - | Generic webhook URL; receives JSON POST on download completion/failure |
| `YTDLP_PLAYER_CLIENT` | *(empty)* | Override yt-dlp YouTube player client (expert-only, e.g. `android`, `web,android`) |
| `YOUTUBE_BOT_BACKOFF_MIN` | `5` | Minimum backoff in seconds before retrying after YouTube bot-detection style failures |
| `YOUTUBE_BOT_BACKOFF_MAX` | `20` | Maximum backoff in seconds before retrying after YouTube bot-detection style failures |

### Navidrome Integration

To enable Navidrome auto-rescan and duplicate detection, add your credentials:

```yaml
environment:
  - NAVIDROME_URL=http://navidrome:4533
  - NAVIDROME_USER=admin
  - NAVIDROME_PASS=yourpassword
```

If running on the same Docker network as Navidrome, use the container name as the hostname.

**For accurate M3U playlist entries**, also add this to your **Navidrome** docker-compose:

```yaml
environment:
  ND_SUBSONIC_DEFAULTREPORTREALPATH: "true"
```

By default, Navidrome's API returns synthetic paths (`Artist/Album/01-Track.mp3`) rather than real filesystem paths. This env var makes it return actual absolute paths, which MusicGrabber needs to correctly populate M3U playlists when a track is found in Navidrome rather than downloaded fresh. The Settings > Navidrome "Test Connection" button will warn you if this isn't set.

### Jellyfin Auto-Rescan

To automatically trigger a Jellyfin library scan after downloads:

```yaml
environment:
  - JELLYFIN_URL=http://jellyfin:8096
  - JELLYFIN_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Get your API key from Jellyfin: Dashboard, API Keys, Add.

### Lidarr Auto-Rescan

MusicGrabber can also poke Lidarr after downloads so it notices new files sooner:

```yaml
environment:
  - LIDARR_URL=http://lidarr:8686
  - LIDARR_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

This is a refresh nudge, not a promise that Lidarr will suddenly become reasonable about singles. We can hope, though.

### Monochrome/Qobuz Source (Optional)

Monochrome is enabled by default. MusicGrabber searches Tidal metadata through a hifi-api compatible endpoint and uses the ISRC to find the same recording. It tries the configured Qobuz proxy first, stepping down quality if necessary, then the fast qbdlx direct-Qobuz route. Only when both fail does the browser-authenticated fallback open headed Chrome under Xvfb to complete the Turnstile flow shown by Monochrome's real web client. Authentication and playback resolution stay in Chrome, while the resulting media URL downloads with MusicGrabber's normal HTTP client.

The first browser-authenticated resolution normally takes several seconds. MusicGrabber keeps that browser and its short-lived JWT session alive, so later fallback tracks avoid another Chrome launch; playback requests are serialised briefly through the one session. If it expires or Monochrome rotates its public client token, MusicGrabber refreshes the public configuration and starts a clean session once. Two consecutive browser failures temporarily mark that fallback unhealthy so a broken Chrome host does not impose the full timeout on every queued track; a retry window opens after ten minutes. Some lossless resources are standard CENC AES-CTR protected FLAC-in-MP4: MusicGrabber keeps the authorised key in memory, downloads the media normally, and asks ffmpeg to decrypt/remux it to a clean FLAC. The key is neither logged nor written to disk, though ffmpeg necessarily receives it as a process argument while remuxing. Preview requests never launch the browser fallback.

You can turn it off in Settings, Search Sources, or use:

```yaml
environment:
  - SOURCE_MONOCHROME_ENABLED=false
  - MONOCHROME_HIFI_API_URL=https://monochrome-api.samidy.com,https://api.monochrome.tf,https://eu-central.monochrome.tf
  - MONOCHROME_QOBUZ_PROXY_URL=https://qdl-api.monochrome.tf
  - MONOCHROME_BROWSER_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true
```

You can point those URLs at self-hosted compatible services if you run them. Disable `MONOCHROME_BROWSER_FALLBACK_ENABLED` if you do not want Chrome launched for failed Monochrome downloads. The Docker image uses Google Chrome on amd64 and matched Debian Chromium/chromedriver packages on ARM. The arm64 image build is validated, but the Turnstile runtime path has less real-world coverage than amd64 and remains more sensitive to upstream browser/driver compatibility. Monochrome results without an ISRC are ignored, because the playback services cannot resolve them and pretending otherwise just wastes everyone's afternoon.

### Notifications (Optional)

Get notified when downloads complete or fail via Telegram, email, or a generic webhook. Configure one or more channels; the same triggers apply to all.

**Notification triggers** (`NOTIFY_ON`):

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `singles` | Notify for each individual track download |
| `playlists` | Notify when playlist downloads complete |
| `bulk` | Notify when bulk imports complete |
| `errors` | Notify when any download fails |

Default is `playlists,bulk,errors`: notifications for playlist/bulk completions and any failures, but not for every single track.

**Telegram setup:**

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token
2. Get your chat ID by messaging [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
3. Build the webhook URL:

```yaml
environment:
  - NOTIFY_ON=playlists,bulk,errors
  - TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/sendMessage?chat_id={chat_id}
```

**Email setup (SMTP):**

```yaml
environment:
  - NOTIFY_ON=playlists,bulk,errors
  - SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
  - SMTP_PORT=587
  - SMTP_USER=user@example.com
  - SMTP_PASS=password
  - SMTP_FROM=musicgrabber@example.com
  - SMTP_TO=you@example.com
  - SMTP_TLS=true
```

`SMTP_TO` can be a comma-separated list for multiple recipients. `SMTP_TLS=true`
means STARTTLS, normally on port 587; implicit TLS on port 465 is not supported.
The Settings page can send a test email using the values currently in the form
and reports connection, STARTTLS, authentication, sender, and recipient failures.

**Generic webhook:**

Set `WEBHOOK_URL` to any URL. MusicGrabber sends a JSON POST with event type, title, artist, status, source, and track counts. Useful for custom integrations (Discord bots, Home Assistant, etc.).

```yaml
environment:
  - WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-endpoint.com/hook
```

### Soulseek Integration (Optional)

MusicGrabber can search [slskd](https://github.com/slskd/slskd) (a Soulseek daemon) for higher quality sources. When enabled, search results from YouTube and Soulseek are shown together, ranked by relevance. Soulseek's declared codec and bitrate contribute to that rank and also feed the separate minimum-quality filter, so a good FLAC match still receives its due without pretending audio quality and title relevance are the same measurement. The peer remains visible as the source of the download but is kept separate from the artist. A search result may initially infer an artist from the remote path; after download, MusicGrabber validates the file in private staging and prefers its embedded `ARTIST` tag before metadata lookup, tagging, duplicate detection, or choosing the library folder. Untagged files fall back to the path guess, since even a folder called `Music (FLAC)` is occasionally all the evidence the internet has volunteered.

Soulseek is disabled by default. Turn it on in Settings under Search Sources, or set `SOURCE_SOULSEEK_ENABLED=true`. Entering credentials alone does not enable it.

**Searching only** (no downloads): Just the API credentials are needed to see Soulseek results without downloading anything:

```yaml
environment:
  - SOURCE_SOULSEEK_ENABLED=true
  - SLSKD_URL=http://slskd:5030
  - SLSKD_USER=your-slskd-username
  - SLSKD_PASS=your-slskd-password
```

**Full integration** (search + download): This is where most people get tripped up, so here is the plain English version of what needs to happen.

When slskd finishes downloading a track, it saves it to a folder on your server. MusicGrabber needs to be able to see that same folder so it can pick the file up, validate it, and copy the finished version into your music library. The two applications are separate Docker containers, so they cannot see each other's files by default. You have to give them both access to the same staging folder on your server.

You do that by adding the same folder to the `volumes:` section of **both** containers in your `docker-compose.yml`. The path on the **left** of the `:` is the folder on your server. The path on the **right** is where that folder appears inside the container. The right-hand path must be the same in both containers.

Keep the three jobs in separate host directories:

- `/srv/music` is the finished library.
- `/srv/slskd/downloads` is temporary, unverified acquisition staging.
- `/srv/slskd/shares` contains only files you have deliberately chosen to share.

Do **not** put the downloads directory inside the slskd shares directory or configure it as a share. A Soulseek filename or `.flac` extension is a claim from a stranger on the internet, not a sworn affidavit. MusicGrabber only validates the file after slskd has downloaded it.

Here is a complete safe-layout example. Both containers see the staging directory as `/downloads`, but MusicGrabber receives read-only access to slskd's copy:

```yaml
services:
  slskd:
    image: slskd/slskd
    volumes:
      - /srv/slskd/downloads:/downloads
      - /srv/slskd/shares:/shares:ro
    environment:
      - SLSKD_DOWNLOADS_DIR=/downloads    # tell slskd to save completed files here

  musicgrabber:
    image: g33kphr33k/musicgrabber:latest
    volumes:
      - /srv/music:/music
      - /srv/slskd/downloads:/downloads:ro
    environment:
      - MUSIC_DIR=/music
      - SOURCE_SOULSEEK_ENABLED=true
      - SLSKD_URL=http://slskd:5030
      - SLSKD_USER=your-slskd-username
      - SLSKD_PASS=your-slskd-password
      - SLSKD_DOWNLOADS_PATH=/downloads   # must match the right-hand path above
```

The right-hand paths (`:/downloads`) match, so both containers are looking at the same staging folder. `SLSKD_DOWNLOADS_PATH` tells MusicGrabber where to find it. MusicGrabber copies the chosen file into `/music`, then performs its integrity, conversion, and metadata work there; the unverified staging copy is never part of the library or the deliberate share. You can set the downloads path in the MusicGrabber Settings tab instead of using the environment variable.

**If slskd runs on a different machine**, expose only its downloads directory over NFS or SMB and mount that read-only in MusicGrabber. Keep the slskd share directories separate and unmounted.

**Note:** Soulseek is a P2P network. Most users run slskd behind a VPN. This integration only talks to your slskd instance; it does not connect directly to the Soulseek network. New accounts may see rejected downloads until they build reputation by sharing files.

### Playlist Import

MusicGrabber can import tracks from Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, YouTube, SoundCloud, Tidal, Beatport, Monochrome, and ListenBrainz playlists. Paste a supported URL in the Bulk Import tab to fetch the track list, then import them via the enabled search sources.

Bulk Import also accepts **MusicBrainz release URLs**, which are handled differently: rather than filling the track list, they queue the release straight down the album pipeline. See *MusicBrainz album URLs* below.

**How it works by source:**

- **Apple Music**: Fetches the public page, extracts Apple's current web MusicKit token from the site bundle, then paginates their `amp-api` track endpoint directly. Falls back to the server-rendered HTML when needed
- **Amazon Music**: Headless browser scraping via Playwright. Slower but reliable for most public playlists
- **Spotify small playlists (under ~100 tracks)**: Uses Spotify's embed endpoint to quickly fetch track data
- **Spotify large playlists (100+ tracks)**: Automatically falls back to headless browser scraping
- **Tidal playlists**: Direct scrape of Tidal's embed player (`embed.tidal.com/playlists/UUID`), which server-renders the full track list. Downloads can use any enabled source
- **Beatport playlists**: Top 100, genre charts, and editorial charts read straight from the page's server-rendered JSON. Folder names are derived from the URL (`/top-100` becomes "Beatport Top 100", `/genre/techno/6/top-100` becomes "Techno Top 100")
- **Monochrome playlists**: Public `monochrome.tf/playlist/...` URLs are fetched via the same hifi-api fallback list as Monochrome search, so the playlist importer benefits from the endpoint rotation when one host wanders off

**MusicBrainz album URLs:**

Paste a `https://musicbrainz.org/release/<mbid>` or `https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/<mbid>` link into the Bulk Import URL box and MusicGrabber queues it as a proper album download rather than a flat track list. Files land in `Albums/Artist/Album/` with cover art, an `.albuminfo` sidecar, and track numbers from the release itself; tracks you already own are skipped.

The MBID is already in the URL, so there is no scraping and no fuzzy matching to get wrong. Release-group URLs (what MusicBrainz search links to) are resolved to the earliest official pressing in the group. If "Create playlist" is ticked, the album M3U name comes from the playlist name field.

**Spotify private playlists and personal library:**

By default, only public Spotify content is accessible. To unlock private playlists, liked songs playlists, and anything else that requires a login, upload your Spotify browser cookies in **Settings, Spotify**.

1. Install a cookie export extension such as [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc) (Chrome) or [cookies.txt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/) (Firefox)
2. Log in to [open.spotify.com](https://open.spotify.com) in your browser
3. Use the extension to export cookies for `open.spotify.com` as a `cookies.txt` file (Netscape format)
4. In MusicGrabber, go to **Settings, Spotify**, click **Upload cookies.txt**, and select the file
5. Click **Test Cookies** to confirm the session is active
6. Private playlist URLs will now work in Bulk Import and Watched Playlists

The `sp_dc` session cookie is what grants access. It has a long expiry (typically ~1 year) but will be invalidated if you log out of Spotify or change your password. If a private playlist suddenly returns an error, your cookies have expired, re-export and paste them in. MusicGrabber will show an amber warning banner in Settings when it detects the cookies have stopped working.

**Apple Music private library playlists:**

Public Apple Music playlists and albums work without credentials. For private `music.apple.com/library/...` playlists, add your Apple Music user token in **Settings, Apple Music**. You only need the `Music-User-Token`; MusicGrabber fetches the current web bearer token automatically from Apple's public bundle.

You can also provide it as an environment variable:

```yaml
environment:
  - APPLE_MUSIC_USER_TOKEN=your-music-user-token
```

**Headless browser method:**

Spotify's embed API only returns approximately 100 tracks. For larger playlists, MusicGrabber launches a headless Chromium browser (via Playwright) that:

- Loads the full Spotify playlist page
- Automatically dismisses the cookie consent banner
- Scrolls through the entire tracklist to load all tracks (Spotify uses virtualised scrolling that lazy-loads content)
- Extracts track information incrementally during scrolling
- Filters out "Recommended" tracks at the bottom (only numbered playlist tracks are imported)

This process takes a few seconds for playlists with hundreds of tracks. Very large playlists (1000+) may take 10-20 seconds.

**Docker requirements:**

The headless browser requires additional shared memory. The docker-compose.yml includes:

```yaml
shm_size: '2gb'  # Required for Chromium
```

### Watched Playlists

Automatically monitor Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, Amazon Music, SoundCloud, Tidal, Beatport, Monochrome, or ListenBrainz playlists for new tracks. When new songs are added to a watched playlist, MusicGrabber will detect them and queue them for download.

**How it works:**

1. Add a playlist URL in the "Watched" tab
2. MusicGrabber fetches the current tracklist and stores hashes of each track
3. A built-in scheduler checks each playlist at its selected interval (30 minutes, hourly, 6/12 hours, daily, weekly, or monthly)
4. New tracks are queued for download, searching only the selected sources for the best quality available
5. If "Generate M3U" is enabled, a `.m3u` file is created and updated on every refresh as new tracks are downloaded

Each watched playlist can also:
- Use Append or Mirror sync for its M3U
- Limit allowed sources, useful when a SoundCloud set must stay on SoundCloud. The selection remains strict during automatic fallback and manual job retry; if every selected source is disabled or unavailable, the track fails instead of wandering off to another provider
- Route downloads into the standard Playlists directory or a custom subfolder under your music root
- Show missing tracks, candidate search results, and manual retry controls when the automatic match is not good enough

Artist guest lists are not required to agree word-for-word across Spotify, Navidrome, Lidarr, and the file on disk. MusicGrabber tries the complete credit first, then falls back to the primary artist when a service has written `Primary Artist, Guest` or `Primary Artist feat. Guest`. If a manual Search download discovers that the primary-artist copy already exists, the watched row is reconciled too: it leaves Missing, gains the reusable path where available, and joins the next M3U rebuild. The guest artist has not been erased from history; the databases have merely stopped arguing over the seating plan.

**Configuration:**

The scheduler runs automatically inside the container. Control it with:

```yaml
environment:
  - WATCHED_PLAYLIST_CHECK_HOURS=24  # Maximum sweep interval (default)
  # Shorter per-playlist/per-artist deadlines wake sooner; 0 disables automation
```

Each playlist and watched artist has its own interval. The scheduler sleeps until the earliest enabled item is due, without exceeding the global sweep interval above. Adding, resuming, or changing an interval wakes it immediately to recalculate; there is no restart ritual and no need to leave a sacrificial playlist by the router.

**Manual refresh:**

Click "Check All Now" in the UI, or "Refresh" on individual playlists to check immediately regardless of the interval.

**API endpoint:**

For external automation, you can also trigger checks via API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:38274/api/watched-playlists/check-all
```

### Reverse Proxy (Caddy example)

```
music.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy music-grabber:8080
}
```

### Reverse Proxy Subpath (`/musicgrabber`)

If you want to serve MusicGrabber from a subpath instead of a subdomain, set:

```yaml
environment:
  - ROOT_PATH=/musicgrabber
```

Then configure your reverse proxy to strip that prefix before forwarding the request to MusicGrabber.

Example Caddy config:

```caddy
my-domain.com {
    handle_path /musicgrabber/* {
        reverse_proxy music-grabber:8080
    }
}
```

Notes:
- `ROOT_PATH` should include the leading slash, for example `/musicgrabber`
- The proxy must remove that prefix before passing the request upstream
- Without `ROOT_PATH`, MusicGrabber assumes it lives at the domain root
- Static assets, frontend API calls, and generated download URLs all respect this prefix

## Usage

### Search and Download

1. **Single tracks:** search for a song on the **Tracks** tab, tap/click the result to download. Searches all enabled sources in parallel
2. **Preview:** on desktop, hover over a result for 2 seconds to hear a preview (works for all sources)
3. **Minimum quality:** filter results to 192/256/320 kbps or lossless. Only Soulseek, Monochrome and FreeMp3Cloud declare a quality before download; YouTube and SoundCloud declare nothing, so they count as *undeclared* and are hidden as soon as you set a minimum. Tick "Keep undeclared" to keep them. Note that results are ordered by search relevance, not audio quality, so an undeclared YouTube result with an exact title match will otherwise outrank genuine lossless ones. The choice is remembered between searches
4. **Playlists:** paste a supported playlist URL in Bulk Import or Watched Playlists to fetch the track list, then queue downloads through your enabled sources
5. **Processing feedback:** shows "Processing..." immediately when tapped, then "Added to queue"

### Bulk Import

Upload a text file or paste a list of songs in the format:
```
ABBA – Dancing Queen
ABBA – Super Trouper
Backstreet Boys – I Want It That Way
```

The app will:
- Search enabled sources for each song automatically
- Queue downloads for the best matches
- Show success/failure summary
- Offer **Cancel**, which lets the active file finish and cancels everything untouched without deleting Queue rows
- Optionally create a playlist and route files into Playlists or a custom watched-playlist folder

Supports various dash formats: `-`, `–`, `--`

### Queue Management

- **View progress:** see queued, in-progress, completed, and failed jobs
- **Job details:** click completed/failed jobs to see source, timestamps, download duration, and audio quality
- **Play:** completed downloads have a play/stop button for instant in-browser preview
- **Re-download:** re-queue any completed or failed download (overwrites existing file)
- **Report bad tracks:** flag wrong tracks, ContentID dodges, or poor quality from the queue. Blacklisted videos are excluded from future searches
- **Edit tags:** completed downloads can be retagged from the queue, including artist, title, album, album artist, year, and track number. MusicBrainz can have a guess too, which is handy when the filename is doing its best impression of a ransom note
- **Why this result?:** automated downloads record the scorer's reasoning, including the winning score and a few near misses
- **Force accept:** watched-playlist mismatches can be accepted manually when the source metadata is messy but your ears say it is the right track
- **Trash:** move audio files (and lyrics) to `/data/.trash/` instead of permanently deleting them. Trashed files can be played and restored from the Trash Bin section at the bottom of the Queue tab
- **Trash bin:** lists all trashed files with per-file Play, Restore, and permanent Delete buttons. "Empty Trash" clears the lot (admin only). Files that fail mismatch or duration checks during download also land here automatically
- **Retry failed:** click retry on individual failed downloads
- **Queue history is retained:** completed and failed rows remain available for
  inspection until someone deliberately uses **Clear Queue**. The browser asks
  for confirmation and the API independently requires `?confirm=true`, which
  keeps an enthusiastic script or test run from erasing the lot by accident

## File Structure

Downloads are organised as:
```
/music/
├── Singles/
│   ├── Artist Name/              # When "Organise by Artist" is on (default)
│   │   ├── Track Title.flac
│   │   └── 1 - Track Title.flac  # With "Include Track Number in Filename" on
│   ├── Artist Name - Track Title.flac  # When "Organise by Artist" is off
│   └── Playlist Name.m3u
├── Playlists/                    # Optional, when PLAYLISTS_SUBDIR is set
│   └── Playlist Name/
│       └── Artist Name - Track Title.flac
└── Albums/
    └── Artist Name/
        └── Album Name/
            ├── 01 - Track Title.flac
            ├── cover.jpg
            └── Album Name.m3u
```

- By default, tracks go into `Singles/Artist/` directories
- Disable "Organise by Artist" in Settings to put all tracks directly in `Singles/` with `Artist - Title` filenames
- Enable "Include Track Number in Filename" in Settings to prefix saved files with the resolved track number when MusicBrainz or source tags provide one
- Set `PLAYLISTS_SUBDIR` or use the Settings tab to put playlist-routed downloads under a dedicated Playlists folder
- Album downloads land under `Albums/Artist/Album/` by default, with MusicBrainz track context and optional album-local M3U files
- Playlist downloads generate `.m3u` files with relative paths
- Watched playlists with M3U enabled keep their `.m3u` file updated on every refresh cycle
- Artist and title are extracted from source metadata, with YouTube and SoundCloud titles parsed when needed
- Common patterns like "Artist - Title" are parsed automatically
- YouTube annotations (Official Audio, Lyrics, etc.) are cleaned from titles

### Metadata

With `ENABLE_MUSICBRAINZ=true`:
1. Fingerprints the downloaded audio with AcoustID/Chromaprint to identify the actual recording
2. If AcoustID matches confidently, uses the correct artist, title, album, and year from MusicBrainz
3. Falls back to a text-based MusicBrainz search if fingerprinting fails or scores too low. For bootleg-heavy catalogues where the best search hit appears on only a handful of releases, it checks the exact-title single/EP release group and follows the recording reused across its official editions back to a studio album; well-supported results keep the normal two-request path
4. Falls back to cleaned source metadata if neither lookup finds anything
5. Sets album to "Singles" by default when no album is found
6. Fetches proper cover art using Cover Art Archive, then iTunes/Deezer fallbacks, keeping source thumbnails as the last resort

Manual selections intentionally bypass the canonical MusicBrainz duration rejection so you can choose a live version, remix, edit, or extended mix. They still have an independent completeness check: when the selected search result advertised a duration, downloaded audio shorter by more than both 10% and 15 seconds is rejected as a likely preview/sample or truncated response. If the source supplied no duration, MusicGrabber keeps the existing codec, container, start-offset, silence, and HTTP content-length checks rather than inventing one.

### ReplayGain

Off by default. With `ENABLE_REPLAYGAIN=true` (or the Settings toggle), each finished download is measured and tagged with ReplayGain 2.0 values:

- **Track gain and peak** are written against the spec's -18 LUFS reference. The measurement reuses the same EBU R128 pass as loudness normalisation
- **Nothing is re-encoded.** Only tags are written, so this is safe on lossless files and undone by deleting four tags. It is the non-destructive alternative to `NORMALISE_LOSSY_AUDIO`, which does rewrite the audio
- **Album gain and peak** are added once every track of an album has landed, calculated across the whole record so quiet tracks stay quiet relative to loud ones rather than being levelled individually
- **Existing tags are preserved** unless `REPLAYGAIN_REPLACE_EXISTING=true`
- **Supported containers:** FLAC, MP3, M4A/MP4, Ogg, Opus. WebM has nowhere to put the tags and is skipped

If both `NORMALISE_LOSSY_AUDIO` and `ENABLE_REPLAYGAIN` are on, normalisation runs first and ReplayGain measures the result, so the tags describe the file as it actually sits on disk.

### Duplicate Detection

Before downloading, checks if the track already exists:
- Exact filename match
- Case-insensitive matching
- One-level-deep artist/album folders created by auto-album routing
- Optional Navidrome/Subsonic lookup, if configured
- Skips download and reports as duplicate, while still using the existing path for playlist M3U routing when possible

## Security

MusicGrabber has two layers of auth:

- **Single-user mode:** no login by default, unless you set `API_KEY`
- **Multi-user mode:** starts when you create two or more users. Requests use bearer session tokens from `/api/auth/login`; `X-API-Key` still works as an admin fallback for scripts

### API Key Authentication

Enable API key authentication by setting a key in the Settings tab or via environment variable:

```yaml
environment:
  - API_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```

When enabled:
- Single-user API requests require the `X-API-Key` header
- In multi-user mode, normal browser/API clients should use `Authorization: Bearer <session-token>`
- `X-API-Key` remains available for automation and is treated as admin access
- Rate limiting applies: 200 requests per minute per IP address

**Setting up:**

1. Go to Settings, Security
2. Enter an API key (any string you choose)
3. Save settings
4. The browser will prompt you for the key

**Environment variable override:** If `API_KEY` is set in the environment, it overrides the database value and cannot be changed via the UI.

**curl examples:**

```bash
# API key mode
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key-here" http://localhost:38274/api/jobs

# Session mode
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:38274/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"karl","password":"your-password"}' | jq -r .token)

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:38274/api/jobs
```

For browser-native file downloads in multi-user mode, the frontend asks `/api/auth/download-token` for a short-lived, single-use download token. The old `?api_key=` download trick is disabled by default because URLs end up in logs, browser history, proxy access logs, and other places secrets should not be having a wander. Set `ALLOW_API_KEY_QUERY_PARAM=true` only if you need backwards compatibility.

### Roles

| Role | What it can do |
|------|----------------|
| `admin` | Full access, global settings, users, stats reset, blacklist, trash emptying |
| `user` | Own queue, watched playlists/artists, album workflows, personal credentials, notifications, and password |
| `peon` | Search, Bulk Import, Queue, Albums, and Watched. No Settings or Stats, and conversion/source settings are inherited from admin |

Single-user installs are still admin-equivalent and need no account unless you want multi-user mode.

### Additional Security Considerations

- For external access, consider a reverse proxy with additional authentication (Caddy, nginx, Authelia)
- The API allows triggering downloads and file operations, so treat access as administrative
- Rate limiting helps prevent abuse but isn't a substitute for proper access control

**Example: Adding basic auth with Caddy (in addition to API key):**

```
music.yourdomain.com {
    basicauth * {
        username $2a$14$hashed_password_here
    }
    reverse_proxy music-grabber:8080
}
```

## Updating yt-dlp

YouTube changes frequently. To update yt-dlp inside the container:

```bash
docker compose exec music-grabber yt-dlp -U
```

Or rebuild the image to get the latest version:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

**Downloads staying inside container / not appearing in mounted volume?**
- Ensure your volume mount matches the `MUSIC_DIR` environment variable
- The default is `MUSIC_DIR=/music`, so mount your music folder to `/music`:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - /path/to/your/music:/music  # This MUST match MUSIC_DIR
  environment:
    - MUSIC_DIR=/music
  ```
- Check inside the container: `docker exec music-grabber ls -la /music/Singles/`

**Files created as root / permission denied?**
- By default, the container runs as root (UID 0)
- Set `PUID` and `PGID` to match your host user (like the *arr stack):
  ```yaml
  environment:
    - PUID=1000
    - PGID=1000
  ```
- Find your UID/GID with: `id $USER`
- Double-check the values are correct; a wrong `PUID`/`PGID` can also break Spotify playlist imports (Chromium won't launch if it can't write to its temp directories)
- TrueNAS commonly uses service UID/GID `568`. Debian may print `useradd warning: ... outside of the UID_MIN ... range` when the container creates that account. This is cosmetic: low numeric IDs are supported. Check that the container becomes healthy and that the host dataset grants `568:568` write access; changing the IDs merely to silence the warning usually swaps a harmless complaint for a real permissions problem

**Browser fallbacks failing?**
- Large Spotify playlists and Monochrome's browser-authenticated fallback need extra shared memory:
  ```yaml
  shm_size: '2gb'
  ```
  Add this to the `music-grabber` service block in `docker-compose.yml`
- If you see a truncation warning in the UI, the headless browser crashed; the error message should tell you why
- On ARM (NAS, Raspberry Pi) or low-RAM hosts, Chromium can silently crash even with `shm_size` set. Spotify then returns the embed result (up to ~100 tracks); Monochrome proceeds to its remaining non-browser fallbacks
- Wrong `PUID`/`PGID` values can also prevent Chromium from launching; check those first

**Downloads failing with 403 errors?**
- YouTube's bot detection may be blocking requests
- Go to Settings, YouTube and upload browser cookies (export from a browser where you're signed into YouTube)
- Use a cookie export extension like "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" (Chrome/Firefox)
- Cookies expire periodically; re-export if downloads start failing again

**Private Spotify playlist returns "not found" or "expired cookies" error?**
- Private playlists require authentication cookies, see the Spotify private playlists section above
- If you had working cookies and they've stopped, Spotify invalidated the session (logout, password change, or long inactivity). Re-export from `open.spotify.com` and paste them in Settings, Spotify
- An amber warning banner appears in Settings when MusicGrabber detects the cookies have expired; it clears automatically when valid cookies are saved

**Downloads failing for other reasons?**
- Check `docker compose logs music-grabber`
- YouTube may have changed something; try updating yt-dlp
- Some videos are region-locked or age-restricted

**Navidrome not seeing new files?**
- Verify the volume mount paths match
- Check Navidrome's scan interval if auto-rescan isn't configured
- Manually trigger a scan in Navidrome's UI

**Watched playlist says tracks are downloaded, but the M3U is missing some entries?**
- First check Navidrome for stale missing-file records. A normal scan does not always purge deleted entries.
- In Navidrome, go to `Settings -> Missing Files`, then `Select All -> Remove From Database`
- Trigger a full library scan in Navidrome after that cleanup
- In MusicGrabber, refresh the watched playlist again (or remove and re-add it if you want a clean retest)
- If a few tracks still route to `Singles/` unexpectedly, check logs for older runs before this fix, stale state can be a bit stubborn
- Short version: if Navidrome keeps ghosts, playlist routing gets confused

**Can't access from phone?**
- Ensure port 38274 is open on your firewall
- If using a reverse proxy, check the configuration

**Bulk import not finding songs?**
- Check the format is "Artist - Song" (with a dash separator)
- Try more specific search terms
- Some obscure tracks may not be on YouTube
- Check the results summary for failed searches

**Want to go back to single-user mode after enabling multi-user?**
- You don't need to wipe the database. Run this command **on the host** to drop all user accounts from inside the container:
  ```bash
  docker exec music-grabber python3 -c "
  import sqlite3
  conn = sqlite3.connect('/data/music_grabber.db')
  conn.execute('DELETE FROM users')
  conn.execute('DELETE FROM sessions')
  conn.commit()
  print('Done')
  "
  ```
- The app detects the change within 30 seconds, no restart needed. All your jobs, watched playlists, and settings are preserved.
- To go back fully from scratch, stop the container, delete `/data/music_grabber.db`, and start it again.

**Metadata quality issues?**
- Ensure `ENABLE_MUSICBRAINZ=true` in environment variables (or enable it in the Settings tab)
- AcoustID fingerprinting identifies most well-known tracks automatically; MusicBrainz text search is the fallback
- Both are confidence-gated; low-confidence matches are rejected rather than applied, so no metadata is better than wrong metadata
- Very short clips (under ~5 seconds) may not fingerprint reliably
- Obscure or newly released tracks may not be in AcoustID or MusicBrainz yet; metadata will come from YouTube/SoundCloud channel info instead
- If fingerprinting stops working, the shared built-in AcoustID key may have hit its rate limit. Register a free personal key at [acoustid.org](https://acoustid.org/login) and enter it in Settings > General > AcoustID API Key (or set `ACOUSTID_API_KEY` env var)

## AI Use

MusicGrabber is human-directed and AI-assisted. At this point, pretty much any
originally human-written starter code has been replaced or heavily rewritten,
so the current codebase is roughly **90% AI-written code**, maybe more.

The project direction, feature choices, code checks, manual QA testing, release
decisions, and day-to-day use are all human. This is not a throwaway generated
demo; it is personally used and maintained.
